## Frontend

### General Guidelines

- Shared/*Layout.razor — application structure (navbar, sidebar, footer).
- Pages/*.razor — routable views defined with @page.
- Components/*.razor — reusable, non-routable UI pieces.
- Components and parameters in PascalCase.
- Event parameters follow the OnXxx pattern and use EventCallback (not Action).
- Keep UI markup in .razor, move logic to code-behind: Component.razor.cs (partial class).
- Prefer dependency injection over statics/singletons.
- Local UI state stays in the component; shared state via scoped services or CascadingParameter.
- Parent–child communication via EventCallback and parameters.

### Performance & Rendering
- Use <Virtualize> for long lists.
- Provide stable keys in loops: @key item.Id.
- Avoid unnecessary state changes; override ShouldRender only when it clearly reduces renders.
- Prefer OnInitializedAsync over OnInitialized for async work.
- Use RenderFragment/RenderFragment<T> for flexible, composable UIs.

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Bootstrap

- Implement dark mode with the data-bs-theme="dark"
- Customize with Bootstrap CSS variables; avoid heavy overrides of core CSS
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements
- Scope component styles with Component.razor.css.
- Keep theme variables in :root and [data-bs-theme=dark].

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements
